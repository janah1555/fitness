               <p>Regular Exercise – Aim for a mix of cardio, strength, and flexibility workouts at least 3-4 times a week. It doesn’t have to be a long session—just stay consistent!<br>

                Balanced Diet – Eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Stay hydrated and avoid processed foods and too much sugar.<br>
                
                Sleep – Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night. Your body needs rest to recover and rebuild muscles, and lack of sleep can affect your energy and motivation.<br>
                
                Stay Active Throughout the Day – Take breaks to stretch, walk, or move around. It helps prevent stiffness and boosts your metabolism. Try to avoid long periods of sitting.<br>
                
                Mental Health – Take care of your mental well-being by practicing stress management techniques like meditation, journaling, or spending time with loved ones. A healthy mind supports a healthy body!</p>
